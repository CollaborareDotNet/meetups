# Serverless Meetup Program

![](./assets/User_group_web_header.png)

Community-driven Serverless meetups, are hosted locally in cities across the world. Spread the knowledge and experience in building and running applications with serverless architectures at scale, on AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, IBM Cloud Functions, Kubeless, Webtask, and more. Get together to learn about serverless architectures, event-driven application development, microservices, FaaS and severless computing in general.

* **Do you want to start a Serverless Meetup in your city?** 
* **Do you already have a meetup and want us to help you grow it?** 

Join us to be part of the family of many [Serverless Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/serverless/) across the world. 

## Inquiries

We are here to help the local organizers get started with the meetup! In order for us to help you, we request you please fill up the [inquiry form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfSCMFQc47wn1S0Y2H7LBjuvmoZW57cgBSwKC6vdnbd_7yvWA/viewform), and we will contact you at the earliest.

## Get Involved

* **Attend**: We host Serverless Meetups in [many cities](https://www.meetup.com/pro/serverless/) around the world. Attend the next meetup one near you.
* **Organize**: Don't have a Serverless Meetup in your city, but you’re a serverless enthusiast? Do you have strong local connections and organizational skills? We work closely with local partners to help launch new Serverless Meetups.
* **Speak**: We’re always looking for speakers that want to share their experiences and present about serverless, at the meetup groups. Give a presentation, workshop or lightning talk at one of our meetups.
* **Sponsor**: These meetups wouldn’t be possible without the support of our generous sponsors and community partners. Let us know if you’re interested in hosting a Meetup in your office space, or sponsoring food, drinks or other resources.
